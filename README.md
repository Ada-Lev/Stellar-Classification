# Stellar-Classification

Summary: In this study, Stellar Classification Dataset - SDSS17 was explored. This is a multi-
class classification problem with three classes: galaxies, stars, and quasars. The logistic
regression model with multinom function from nnet package was utilised to solve this
problem. The obtained accuracy for distinguishing stars from other classes is 99.4%. The
obtained Ï† coefficient for distinguishing quasars from other classes is 89.2%. The obtained
accuracy for distinguishing galaxies from other classes is 96.2%.
